# Sky React Test

Created with the React Create App.

Allows a user to enter text into a search box, and upon pressing enter or clicking the search button, queries Sky's public endpoint for help pages that contain the search term.  Results are displayed as a list, allowing the user to click on any of the results' URLs.  The results are paginated 10 per page, allowing the user to move to the pavious or next set, or to click directly on the page number.

Entering a URL and querystring such as http://localhost:3000/?sdearch=broadband will pre-populate the search box with the term and perform the search.  This is to enable the browser's history to recall previous searches and repeat them via click the browser back button.  Unfortunately, this is only half complete, as performing a search as normal, does not currently store that search URL within the browser's history.  I simply ran out of time to complete this functionality. I suspect that React Router would enable this to be done.

The specification asked for the ability for users to select "UK" or "ROI" results.  Unfortunately I couldn't see anywhere within the data that is returned by the REST endpoint any geographic attribute.  Neither did I have time to check if the API had any online documentation, which may have pointed to a greographic filter request parameter.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
